# vector_display


## Dependencies

1. [glog](https://github.com/google/glog)
1. [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags)
1. [Lua5.1](http://www.lua.org/)
1. [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/)
1. [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)

You can install the dependencies except for ROS on *buntu using:
```
sudo apt install libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev liblua5.1-0-dev qt5-default
```

For installation instructions for ROS, please consult the [ROS Installation Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Ubuntu)

## Build

1. Add the project directory to `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`:
    ```
    export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=MYDIRECTORY:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
    ```
    (Replace `MYDIRECTORY` with the actual directory)
    You can also add this to your `~/.bashrc` file so that you don't have to do
    this every time you open a new terminal.
1. Build the program:
    ```
    make
    ```
    Optionally, to compile on all cores (make sure you have sufficient RAM!)
    ```
    make -j
    ```
1. Do **not** run `cmake`, `catkin_make`, `rosbuild`.


## Running 

Run `./bin/vector_display`

### Command line flags
 - `--maps_dir` Directory from which to load maps. Default is "maps", which is a submodule of `vector_display` pointing to https://github.com/ut-amrl/amrl_maps
 - `--map` Initial localization map to load. This should be the name of one of the folders in `maps_dir`, as we look for a map at: `(maps_dir)/(map)/(map).vectormap.txt`
 - `--edit_localization` can be set to true to edit localization map (see below)
 - `--edit_navigation` can be set to true to edit navigation map (see below)
 
 ...Additional flags can be discovered by running `./bin/vector_display --help` (the block about flags from `vector_display_thread.cpp` are the most useful).


### Editing a Localization Map
`vector_display` can be used to edit localization maps, which are used by EnML for localization. To edit localization maps, simply run `vector_display` with the `edit_localization` flag set to `true`.

When in map editing mode, `Shift + Click + Drag` will create a new vector line as a part of the map, and `Ctrl + Click` will remove an existing line.
Creating a localization map is best done while running enml and playing through a bag file, so you can observe the long-term features enml picks up on, and add them to the map.

Alternatively, this manual editing can be used to clean up vector maps generated by nautilus (https://github.com/ut-amrl/nautilus)
This map should include any consistent, long-term features the in the environment that are detectable by LiDAR

#### Note
When creating a new localization map, the suggested procedure is to create a new folder in the `maps` directory with the same name as the map, and then from the maps directory perform `cp EmptyMap/EmptyMap.vectormap.txt (map)/(map).txt`

### Editing a Navigation Map
`vector_display` can be used to edit and create navigation maps, which are used by graph navigation (https://github.com/ut-amrl/graph_navigation) for high-level planning. These graphs look like a connected series of nodes and edges, and each edge can be given certain properties (although most such properties are not used in the actual planning yet).

To see an example navigation graph, try running `vector_display` with `edit_navigation` set to true while pointing to a map with an existing navigation graph, such as `UT_Campus`.

When editing a navigation graph, you will see the localization map as well, for reference. `Shift+Click` will create a new node. `Shift + Click + Drag` between any two nodes to create an edge between them. `Ctrl + Click` on a node or edge to delete it. `Alt + Drag` will move an edge or node.

#### Note
When creating a new navigation map for an existing localization map, you must first run, from the maps directory `touch (map)/(map).navigation.txt` to create an empty navigation map file.

## Examples

### Running with EnML
When running EnML(https://github.com/ut-amrl/enml) with the `-d1` flag, visualization messages will be published, which will automatically be displayed by `vector_display`.
